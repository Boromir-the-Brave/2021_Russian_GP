# 2021 Russian Grand Prix: which tires were best on the final laps?

This code was shamelessly stolen from [this](https://medium.com/@jaspervhat/formula-1-data-analysis-tutorial-2021-russian-gp-to-box-or-not-to-box-da6399bd4a39) blog.

This is mostly just a test by me to make sure that I have plenty of examples for future F1 telemetry projects that I hope to do with the `fastf1` python package.
